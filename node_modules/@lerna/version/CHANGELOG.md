# [3.0.0](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/compare/v3.0.0-rc.0...v3.0.0) (2018-08-10)


### Features

* Split `lerna version` from of `lerna publish` ([#1522](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/issues/1522)) ([8b97394](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/commit/8b97394)), closes [#277](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/issues/277) [#936](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/issues/936) [#956](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/issues/956) [#961](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/issues/961) [#1056](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/issues/1056) [#1118](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/issues/1118) [#1385](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/issues/1385) [#1483](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/issues/1483) [#1494](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/issues/1494)


### BREAKING CHANGES

* * `--preid` now defaults to "alpha" during prereleases:

  The previous default for this option was undefined, which led to an awkward "1.0.1-0" result when passed to `semver.inc()`.

  The new default "alpha" yields a much more useful "1.0.1-alpha.0" result. Any previous prerelease ID will be preserved, just as it was before.

* `--no-verify` is no longer passed to `git commit` by default, but controlled by the new `--commit-hooks` option:

  The previous behavior was too overzealous, and the new option operates exactly like the corresponding [npm version](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version#commit-hooks) option of the same name.

  As long as your pre-commit hooks are properly scoped to ignore changes in package.json files, this change should not affect you. If that is not the case, you may pass `--no-commit-hooks` to restore the previous behavior.
